# Security Notice - Educational Use Only

## CRITICAL WARNING

**This project contains INTENTIONAL SECURITY VULNERABILITIES for educational purposes.**

### DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION

This codebase includes:
- **Deliberate SQL Injection vulnerabilities**
- **Intentional Command Injection flaws**
- **Planned Prompt Injection weaknesses**
- **Hardcoded test credentials**
- **Disabled security measures**

### Approved Uses

- **Educational demonstrations**
- **Security research**
- **Academic coursework**
- **Defense training**
- **Learning about AI security**

### Prohibited Uses

- **Production deployment**
- **Unauthorized penetration testing**
- **Malicious activities**
- **Public internet exposure**
- **Any illegal purposes**

## Vulnerability Summary

### Attack 1: SQL Injection
- **Location**: AI chat interface via `debug_sql` function
- **Impact**: Direct database access, data extraction, user deletion
- **Purpose**: Demonstrate function calling vulnerabilities

### Attack 2: Command Injection
- **Location**: Newsletter subscription email parameter
- **Impact**: Operating system command execution
- **Purpose**: Show input sanitization failures

### Attack 3: Indirect Prompt Injection
- **Location**: Product reviews processed by AI
- **Impact**: AI behavior manipulation, unauthorized actions
- **Purpose**: Illustrate AI context contamination

## Real-World Mitigation

In production systems, these vulnerabilities should be prevented by:

### SQL Injection Prevention
```python
# Vulnerable (current implementation)
def debug_sql(query):
    return execute_raw_sql(query)

# Secure implementation
def get_user_info(user_id: int):
    return db.execute(
        "SELECT name, email FROM users WHERE id = ?", 
        (user_id,)
    )
```

### Command Injection Prevention
```python
# Vulnerable (current implementation)
def newsletter_subscribe(email):
    os.system(f"echo {email} >> subscribers.txt")

# Secure implementation
import re
def newsletter_subscribe(email):
    if not re.match(r'^[\w\.-]+@[\w\.-]+\.\w+$', email):
        raise ValueError("Invalid email")
    # Use proper email validation and database storage
```

### Prompt Injection Prevention
```python
# Vulnerable (current implementation)
def process_review(review_text):
    prompt = f"Analyze this review: {review_text}"
    return ai_model.generate(prompt)

# Secure implementation
def process_review(review_text):
    # Sanitize input
    sanitized = sanitize_user_input(review_text)
    # Use structured prompts with clear boundaries
    prompt = {
        "system": "You are analyzing customer reviews. Only respond with sentiment analysis.",
        "user_input": sanitized,
        "instructions": "Return only: positive/negative/neutral"
    }
    return ai_model.generate_structured(prompt)
```

## Security Checklist

Before sharing or deploying ANY version:

- [ ] **Remove all .env files** with real API keys
- [ ] **Verify .gitignore** excludes sensitive files
- [ ] **Add educational warnings** to all documentation
- [ ] **Review code comments** for security disclaimers
- [ ] **Test in isolated environment** only
- [ ] **Confirm no production credentials** are included
